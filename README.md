# üõç E-Commerce Store with Nuxt, Netlify Functions, Tigris Cloud and Stripe

> This is forked from [sdras/ecommerce-netlify](https://github.com/sdras/ecommerce-netlify).
> 
> We have made the e-commerce site dynamic by using 
> [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/jamstack) as the backend and also 
> added search capability. Tigris is responsible for storing the product 
> catalog and providing querying and search capabilities. It is integrated 
> with Netlify Functions.
